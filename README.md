# MNIST-Fashion-dataset-Image-classification
This is a NN model for image classification of images to their respective classes imported from MNIST-Fashion datatset.
This dataset consist of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images,where the resolution of each image is 28*28.
The images are converted to gray scale before being processed.
MaxPool is to down-sample the image, reducing its dimensionality and allowing for assumptions to be made about features contained in the sub-regions binned.
The model is trained for specific number of epochs to get the maximum accuracy.
